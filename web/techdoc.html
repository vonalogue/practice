				<header id="intro"><h1>Introduction</h1></header>
				<p>Ever heard of a computer? You probably have heard this question already –– at the public library, where you held up an entire line of pissed-off riffraff as you kept stabbing the keyboard (typing) with one finger, panicking because, much to your disbelief, your password kept showing up as dots on the screen.</p>		<br>
				<p>It's OK –– or, at least, it <em>will</em> be, hopefully. Get your act together. Computers are here to help you do whatever you don't feel like doing –– like basic arithmetic to keep your malignant credit from further sucking up your credit score.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Computers compute. They come with keyboards and <em>mice</em> to make it easier for you to find a common language with these boxed-up little miracles. If you know how to sit in place for long hours and use a typewriter, you should be able to operate a computer. Don't be lazy or delusional. </p>

				<header id="setup"><h1>
 Set it up!</h1></header>
				<p>Boy, if it isn't that time to harass every unfortunate soul you come across to figure out how to put a working computer together. Before you ostracize yourself, here's something you can do:
					<ol style="font-size: 1.75em">
						<li>Go to the store</li>
						<li>Buy it</li>
						<li>Go home</li>
						<li>Remove it from its box</li>
						<li>Plug it into an outlet</li>
						<li>Push the POWER button</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="main-section">
				<header id="navigation"><h1>
					Navigation</h1></header>
				<p>Did I mention keyboards and mice? They usually come in handy. You type characters with the keyboard and drag your mouse to aim the cursor at whatever you want to click to open, execute, or perform other actions. When you explore your files, there are arrows and other convenient little "hints" that you can use for guidance, especially if you can't read.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="main-section">
				<header id="todo"><h1>Things to do</h1></header>
				<p>The possibilites are <em>endless</em>, and I'm not some sleazy huckster who has the gumption to butter you up for a buck. After all, some possibilities are undesirable –– like misusing the computer to talk shit to people you've never seen in your life or to build your own cult of personality across social media like a career-oriented headcase. I may sound brazen, but I'm still considerate and optimistic enough to forewarn you of user-made pitfalls.</p>
				<br>
				<p>You can also play games like Minesweeper.</p>

			<section class="main-section">
				<header id="uses"><h1>Why use it?</h1></header>
				<p>Wonderful question. Instead of letting you do some critical thinking on your own to figure this one out, I'll go ahead and spoonfeed you an answer: you should use a computer because you need to stop wasting time.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Stop living under a rock. Stop worrying about how much you're gonna spend on your next walk or flight. Wanna go to the Bahamas like any other unimaginative schmuck? Here: open up this thing called a <em>browser</em> and search for "Bahamas"; eventually, you'll find a picture you can stare at as you fill up a tumbler with your favorite low-shelf alcohol and a fruity mixer –– with a little paper umbrella to top it all off. </p>
				<br>
				<p><em>There you go.</em> Now, you can go ahead and take a picture of yourself wearing sunglasses right in front of the computer with your homemade cocktail in hand. Tell everyone about it, including people you would've never spoken to before getting a computer.</p>
