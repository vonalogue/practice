                <p id="why-info">Ever think of how much of a pain in the ass it is to hold a steering wheel or press a pedal? Ever think of how uncomfortable it is to sit there and pay attention to the road? I do, too — all the time, in fact. This is where <em>Yugo</em> comes in.
    				<br><br>
    				Ever heard of Yugo? I had never heard of it either until just recently. Driverless cars happen to be almost as old as Yugo, having originally been built with some semblance of functionality back in the late 80s and early 90s (and conceptualized decades prior). This means that they're even older than <em>hype</em> itself.
                    <br><br>
                    You'll finally inch closer to everyone's apparent dream of doing nothing by taking a 500-mile nap in a refurbished Yugo.

                <p id="how-info">How does it work? Frankly, I'm somewhat afraid to answer that question; it might go over your head a little bit. Anyway, it uses a centralized AI system: first, you wire a telegram containing driving instructions over to Belgrade (trust me — it's easier than it sounds); then, Belgrade feeds the telegram to a machine that transmits signals to the car you're driving via satellite.
    			<br><br>
                Yes, it's still <em>your</em> responsibility to put the "intelligence" in AI, a skill that takes irony to master; the rest is artifice, unless you're full of enough shit to cover the "artifice" part, too.
                <br><br>
                If you see an exposed electromagnetic spool dangling underneath the console, that's the main component responsible for controlling the car. Don't nudge it or touch it in any way. Always drive safe. Never ask strangers for help.</p>

			<h1 id="future-nav">The <s>past</s> future Yugo is building</h1>
            <section id="future" class="container">

                <p id="future-info">Don't mind the redaction there. We're <em>still</em> dedicated to helping people move around without knowing what <s>hit</s> is needed of them. We envision a future in which we can pay next to nothing for <s>responsibility</s>, especially when it comes to dealing with insurance. In other words, no one's going to pay for it.
                <br><br>
                Our philosophy is such: be prepared to cut your losses — if they're evenly distributed, anyway. Secondly, always take the chance to have someone else (i.e. Belgrade) do the dirty work for you. We're all above steering wheels and mashing pedals, especially when dragging your feet isn't even an option due to infrastructure that ends every two miles.
