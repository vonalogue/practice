# Branch information


###### - practice_problems/

A handful of Python solutions to algorithmic problems along with some experimental "ad hoc" Java code here and there, including that which I wrote to create a simple MIDI program that performs music.

###### -  practice_problems/javascript/

As the name implies, these are all short and sweet JavaScript solutions to a host of algorithmic problems that range from finding the sum of fibonacci numbers in a given range to iterating through different objects and comparing their properties.       

###### -  practice_problems/five_problems/

Five problems that, according to some guy on the Internet, "every programmer is supposed to solve." I decidedly took on the challenge with the help of Python.


###### - practice_problems/web/

Contains single-page (satirical) websites that I made as projects to attain my front-end development certification on freeCodeCamp. Don't get offended -- it's not fun. Consult the README.MD file for links to the sites on codepen.io.
