- ### ./

A handful of Python solutions to advanced algorithmic problems (e.g. the reinventing of heapsort and mergesort) along with some experimental Java code here and there, including that which I wrote to create a simple (and incomplete) MIDI program that performs music.

- ### ./five_problems/

Five problems that, [according to some guy on the Internet](https://www.shiftedup.com/2015/05/07/five-programming-problems-every-software-engineer-should-be-able-to-solve-in-less-than-1-hour), every programmer is supposed to "solve in less than one hour." I decidedly took on the challenge with the help of Python.

Although I managed to solve the first four problems within an hour, the fifth problem's complexity required much more time beyond this time frame.

- ### ./javascript/

These are JavaScript solutions to a host of intermediate algorithmic problems that range from finding the sum of prime numbers in a given range to iterating through nested objects and comparing their properties.       

- ### ./javascript/camp_projects

These are five projects (small console programs) I made while studying data structures and algorithms in JavaScript on a website that offers problems in a "code camp" format.

- ### ./web/

These are single-page websites that I made to learn how to use JS/CSS/HTML, React, and Redux (although I never used the latter two again).

You can check out these sites on my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/vonalogue/#) and [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/u/vonalogue) pages. Don't take any of the humor on these sites seriously.
