- ### practice_problems/

A handful of Python solutions to advanced algorithmic problems (e.g. the reinventing of heapsort and mergesort) along with some experimental "ad hoc" Java code here and there, including that which I wrote to create a simple MIDI program that performs music.

- ### practice_problems/five_problems/

Five problems that, [according to some guy on the Internet](https://www.shiftedup.com/2015/05/07/five-programming-problems-every-software-engineer-should-be-able-to-solve-in-less-than-1-hour), "every programmer is supposed to solve." I decidedly took on the challenge with the help of Python.

- ### practice_problems/javascript/

As the name implies, these are all short and sweet JavaScript solutions to a host of intermediate algorithmic problems that range from finding the sum of prime numbers in a given range to iterating through nested objects and comparing their properties.       

- ### practice_problems/javascript/camp_projects

These are the five projects I had to complete in order to receive the **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures** certification from freeCodeCamp.

- ### practice_problems/web/

Contains single-page websites that I made as projects to attain my front-end development certification on freeCodeCamp. You can check out the sites on my [CodePen page](https://codepen.io/vonalogue/#).
