- ### ./

A handful of Python solutions to advanced algorithmic problems (e.g. the reinventing of heapsort and mergesort) along with some experimental Java code here and there, including that which I wrote to create a simple MIDI program that performs music.

- ### ./five_problems/

Five problems that, [according to some guy on the Internet](https://www.shiftedup.com/2015/05/07/five-programming-problems-every-software-engineer-should-be-able-to-solve-in-less-than-1-hour), evey programmer is supposed to "solve in less than one hour." I decidedly took on the challenge with the help of Python.

Although I managed to solve the first four problems within an hour, the fifth problem's complexity required more time beyond this time frame.

- ### ./javascript/

As the name implies, these are all short and sweet JavaScript solutions to a host of intermediate algorithmic problems that range from finding the sum of prime numbers in a given range to iterating through nested objects and comparing their properties.       

- ### ./javascript/camp_projects

These are the five projects I had to complete at the end of a series of lessons in order to receive the __JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures__ certification from freeCodeCamp.

- ### ./web/

Contains single-page websites that I made as projects to obtain my __Responsive Web Design__ and __Front-End Libraries__ certifications on freeCodeCamp.
