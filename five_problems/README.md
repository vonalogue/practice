## Technical notes


- ### Problem #4: 

The author of these problems mentions the use of string-padding and type-casting for lexical comparison, a technique one may use to solve this problem.
The author detracted from using padding in favor of simply type-casting two integers to compare as strings, specifically the two possible strings that
the integers can form via concatenation  and then negating the value that `compareTo()` returns in order to compare the first digits of the "integers."


However, there is no need for lexical comparison; I  used the modulo operator to isolate the integer by dividing it by (`10^n-1`), where
`n` is the number of digits in the integer. This obviates using built-in functions for type-casting, which would anyway saddle
the algorithm with more operations and overhead.   

- ### Problem #5:

As daunting as it may seem at first, this problem actually warrants a comprehensible solution. I realized this when I finally conceded that this problem is of the NP-complete sort, concluding that you can only offer an approximate answer â€” or, indeed, offer an exact answer, though only by  "*approximate*" means (e.g. a greedy or brute-force algorithm).

The author of the problem purveys a divide-and-conquer approach that involves solving the individual calculations first before concatenating them
after cycling through each of the three possible operations.  

However, I chose to generate random numbers to select the next operation, opting for a brute-force approach. I chose to 
concatenate the numbers and operations first and then iterate through the resulting string to perform the operations, caching solutions and
terminating the algorithm once the total number of possible solutions is reached. For some reason, I can't help but remain unsatisfied somewhat.
